         5. [Mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) - Markdown + Mermaid = diagrams for your documentation.
         6. [Pandoc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DougFinke.vscode-pandoc) - Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read markdown and (subsets of) reStructuredText, HTML, and LaTeX, and it can write markdown, reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, ConTeXt, PDF, RTF, DocBook XML, OpenDocument XML, ODT, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup.

   2. Best used with:
         1. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) - Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
         2. [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) - MiKTeX is a typesetting system for the Windows operating system. The distribution includes TeX, pdfTeX, XeTeX, LuaTeX, ConTeXt, and a few more. It also includes a set of related programs.[^3]`Backend` 
         3. [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) - The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.[^4]
2. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - A note-taking app that is designed for taking notes. It has a lot of features that make it easier to take notes.`Standalone`
3. [Heynote](https://heynote.com/) - Scratchpad buffer with blocks, and many languages support.`Standalone`
4. [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) - A document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents (WYSIWYM) and not simply their appearance (WYSIWYG).[^3]`Frontend` 

> [!TIP] 
> If you find both setting up and using LaTeX and Lyx to be a hassle, you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) which is an online LaTeX editor. Moreover, you may want to explore [Typst](https://typst.app/) `Beta` which aims to overcome the shortcomings of LaTeX.  



[^3]:  Lyx is the GUI frontend for LaTex distribution backend (e.g. MikTex, TexLive, etc.). It provides a more user-friendly way to write LaTex documents.
[^4]:  Although I'm a big advocate for Linux OS (i.e Arch, Debian), the learning curve is steep and it's not for everyone. WSL is a good alternative for those who wish to use Linux commands on Windows OS.
[^5]: Vim keybindings provide a more efficient way to navigate and edit text. It's a good skill to have if you're going to be working with code or text a lot. I wouldn't advise using Vim, Neovim or -even worse- Emacs as your main text editor, they are not user-friendly and break often with updates.
